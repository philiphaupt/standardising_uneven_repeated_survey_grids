# standardising_uneven_repeated_survey_grids
Aim: Standardise repeated sampling that happens on uneven survey grids. Following annual cockle surveys which happen along specific grids, we sometimes have to re-survey them later in the year. We may then sample a smaller area (i.e. only include core areas where surveys or fishing data indicated stocks were present), and then sub-sample those populations. I.e. double or quadruple the sampling grid. We therefore need to match/reduce the sampling area to the same geographical and then compare densities and weights between uneven sampling numbers.
